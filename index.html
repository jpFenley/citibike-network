          <p class = 'overview'>New York City is home to the nation's largest bike share program, Citi Bike.
            Citi Bike collects and shares data on each ride, including the station and time that each ride 
            started and ended. Finding trends in this data to identify popular routes based 
            on the time of day and day of the week can help Citi Bike riders determine which routes to take 
            and help Citi Bike determine how their bikes should be allocated.</p>
          <p class = 'overview'>This interactive tool explores the trends in Manhattan's rides on Citi Bike in June 2019. Step through 
            a guided exploration of these rides by pressing the "Begin" button above. For a self-guided exploration,
            press the "Jump to Interactive" button in the bottom left at any time.

          <p>This is Manhattan. It is home to over <b>1.6 million</b> people.<br><br>In 2013
          Citi Bike released its bikeshare program. The program has grown since, becoming the largest
          in the United States, and the second largest in the world.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="page" id = 'page2'>
          <p>There are currently <b>419</b> stations in Manhattan. <br><br>
          There are around <b>12,000</b> bicycles across all these stations.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="page" id = 'page3'>
          <p>With <b>419</b> stations that means there are <b>175,142</b> possible rides.<br><br>
          In June of 2019, we saw <b>109,674</b> of these possible ride combinations.<br><br><br>
        However, some of these rides are way more popular than others.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="page" id = 'page4'>
          <p>The <b>4</b> most common rides of all time occur at Governor's Island, between <b>Yankee Ferry Terminal</b>, <b>Soissons Landing</b>
            , and <b>Picnic Point</b> stations. <br><br>

            The reason there only appears to be two rides shown is because the rides go to and from the same station.
          </b></p>
        </div>

        <div class="page" id = 'page5'>
          <p>During the <u>morning</u> we can see <b>Midtown</b> and the <b>Hudson Yards</b> being the most popular ride locations. These
            happen to be some of the most common places to work in the city. <br><br>

            Due to how popular certain stations and rides are at this time, many users encounter empty stations without bikes.
            Citi Bike has been attempting to relocate bikes to match this demand, but the issue is still present.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="page" id = 'page6'>
          <p>During the <u>afternoon</u> <b>Central Park</b> is a common ride location. <br><br>
            <b>Hudson yards</b> and <b>Midtown</b> are still popular routes, most likely caused by the same
            morning commuters heading home.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="page" id = 'page7'>
          <p>At <u>night</u>, <b>Central Park</b> has practically no rides as it closes after 1am. <br><br>
            <b>Chelsea</b> and the <b>East Village</b> are the most popular ride locations. These locations are
            where a lot of nightlife and bars are located.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="page" id = 'page8'>
          <p>During <u>weekdays</u> the most popular routes are very similar to the most popular during the morning and afternoon commutes. 
            It is mostly commuting to and from work at the <b>Hudson Yards</b> and <b>Midtown</b> stations.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="page" id = 'page9'>
          <p>During <u>weekends</u> almost all rides appear to be leisurely. The most common paths are along
            the Hudson river in <b>Hudson Yards</b> and through <b>Central Park</b>. There is very limited
            riding through the city itself.
