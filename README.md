## Interactive Version [Here](https://jpfenley.github.io/citibike-network/)

Website with visualizations created in d3 for CS639 at UW-Madison. First attempt at using HTML, CSS, and javascript.

Data provided by Citibike in 2019. Rides were filtered to those in Manhattan, then aggregated by starting and ending stations at different times of the day and days of the week. The stations and most popular rides are used to create a graph which can be explored and changed by the user.
